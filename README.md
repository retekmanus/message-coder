coder   :  encodes a given message based on a given key and then displays it in the terminal

decoder  :  decodes a message based on a given key and encoded message

coder-write   :  encodes and writes the key and encoded message in a txt file

decoder-read   :  reads in the key and encoded message from the txt file and displays the original message in terminal

coder master key   :   adds another level of encryption with an additional key given by the user

decoder master key    :   decodes the dual key encrypted message with the same principle as the first variation
